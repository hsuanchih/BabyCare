# BabyCare (Initial Product Prototype)

BabyCare is a mobile app designed to supplement the BabyCare product(packaged with an IP camera, a wristband capable of collecting & reporting heart rate and body temperature, and a weight scale).

This repository hosts the implementation of the initial product prototype, which is now obsolete (the official version has undergone
numerous iterations of UI & functional re-design;  go to https://itunes.apple.com/app/qu-bao-bao-tie-xin-shou-hu/id968231213?mt=8 to 
download the official version).
 
Proprietary logic (web service, live streaming solution, etc) has been removed from this version & relevant implementations are
replaced with data generation coordinated with local persistent store in light of open-sourcing.
